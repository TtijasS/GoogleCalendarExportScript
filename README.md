# GoogleCalendarExportScript
A bit clumsy but a working Excell spreadsheet to google calencar .ics export script

Note: I used this script while working on a primary school to export events from excel spreadsheet to .ics format and import that to google calendar
so first check the excel doc to get familliar with the inpurt spreadsheet format

How to use
1.) Prepare input file
2.) In the script main.py file change the "sheet_name" variable value to the desired sheet name. Februar, Marec, April etc... month names in Slovene
3.) Run the script, choose the input file that tkinter window prompts, exported file shows up in the same folder as the input file (al least it should)
